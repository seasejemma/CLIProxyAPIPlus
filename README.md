# CLIProxyAPI Plus

English | [Chinese](README_CN.md)

This is the Plus version of [CLIProxyAPI](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI), adding support for third-party providers on top of the mainline project.

All third-party provider support is maintained by community contributors; CLIProxyAPI does not provide technical support. Please contact the corresponding community maintainer if you need assistance.

The Plus release stays in lockstep with the mainline features.

## Differences from the Mainline

- Added GitHub Copilot support (OAuth login), provided by [em4go](https://github.com/em4go/CLIProxyAPI/tree/feature/github-copilot-auth)
- Added Kiro (AWS CodeWhisperer) support (OAuth login), provided by [fuko2935](https://github.com/fuko2935/CLIProxyAPI/tree/feature/kiro-integration), [Ravens2121](https://github.com/Ravens2121/CLIProxyAPIPlus/)

## Contributing

This project only accepts pull requests that relate to third-party provider support. Any pull requests unrelated to third-party provider support will be rejected.

If you need to submit any non-third-party provider changes, please open them against the mainline repository.

## More choices

Those projects are ports of CLIProxyAPI or inspired by it:

### [9Router](https://github.com/decolua/9router)

A Next.js implementation inspired by CLIProxyAPI, easy to install and use, built from scratch with format translation (OpenAI/Claude/Gemini/Ollama), combo system with auto-fallback, multi-account management with exponential backoff, a Next.js web dashboard, and support for CLI tools (Cursor, Claude Code, Cline, RooCode) - no API keys needed.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you have developed a port of CLIProxyAPI or a project inspired by it, please open a PR to add it to this list.
